## üìä How It Works

### Data Sources

The dashboard is designed to work with financial data from various sources:

- Stock price and historical data
- Company fundamentals
- Analyst ratings
- Technical indicators
- Financial statements

Currently, the dashboard is connected to financial APIs like Alpha Vantage, Tiingo, and other proprietary data sources.

Then I use this data and send to to the LLM using Groq to perform the analysis and return their predicted data.

### AI Analysis Methodology

The AI analysis engine evaluates stocks based on four key dimensions:

1. **Valuation**: Compares P/E ratio, PEG ratio, and other valuation metrics against industry averages
2. **Growth Potential**: Analyzes earnings growth, revenue growth, and forward-looking indicators
3. **Profitability**: Evaluates profit margins, ROE, ROA, and operational efficiency
4. **Risk Assessment**: Measures volatility (beta), financial stability, and market position

Each dimension receives a score from 0-100, which is then weighted to produce an overall investment score and recommendation.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
